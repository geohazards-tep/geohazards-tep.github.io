## The Thematic Exploitation Platforms (TEPs) activity originated by ESA

The geohazards platform or GEP serves as a means to support the use of satellite EO for geohazards risk assessment. It is an evolution of ESAâ€™s Supersites Exploitation Platform (SSEP) which is based on the ESA Grid Processing on Demand (G-POD) processing environment and was developed for specialized exploitation of EO data resources in the context of the Geohazard Supersites & Natural Laboratories and since then has been expanded to address objectives of the broader geohazards community. In parallel to geohazards ESA is preparing other satellite EO based Thematic Exploitation Platforms (TEPs) top address other themes i.e. hydrology, polar, costal, forestry and urban. These TEPs serve a unique role in that they both facilitate access and processing of large datasets and federate communities of users around common goals, promoting shared science objectives and better use of satellite EO.
